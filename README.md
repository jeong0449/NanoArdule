# Ardule Project — Arduino Nano-based Drum Patternology Ecosystem

> **Note:** This repository is currently undergoing internal testing.  
> Components will be released sequentially as they become stable.

**Ardule** is a complete open ecosystem for drum-pattern creation, conversion, playback, and analysis.  
It integrates **Arduino-based real-time drum engines**, a Python-based pattern studio (APS), a curated pattern library,  
and a family of **lightweight pattern formats (ADT, ADP, ADS, ARR)**.

With the addition of the **ADC Toolchain (adc- prefix)**, Ardule now supports automated conversion of MIDI drum patterns into ADT format, enabling seamless integration of external rhythm material into the ecosystem.

# 🌐 Ecosystem Overview

## 1. The Hardware: Nano Ardule

The hardware is assembled on a perfboard, where an Arduino Nano and other components are hand-wired and securely mounted.

The drum pattern player requires higher performance and therefore uses an **Arduino Nano Every**, while the MIDI controller firmware is intended for the classic **Arduino Nano**.  
Depending on the intended use, the Arduino board can be swapped via a socket.

For detailed hardware documentation, including schematics and implementation notes, see  
[`hardware.md`](./docs/hardware.md).


## 2. Nano Ardule Drum Pattern Player (Firmware)

## Firmware Scope

This repository currently focuses on the **Drum Pattern Player firmware**,
which implements the ADT/ADP-based pattern playback engine and serves as the
reference implementation of the Ardule pattern system.

Another firmware variant, the **MIDI Controller** (e.g. a **Type-0 MIDI file
player** with program change, layering, splitting, and more; see the demo
video on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyeiwCxAJcU), exists
internally and is not part of the public release at this time, but **may be
published in the future as the project evolves and matures**.

This firmware is designed as a real-time drum pattern engine for
**Arduino Nano / Nano Every**.


- ADS streaming engine  
- GM/GS/XG CH10 playback  
- Program Change kit switching  
- LCD user interface  
- MicroSD pattern library  
- MIDI routing

## 3. Ardule Pattern Studio — APS

**Ardule Pattern Studio (APS)** is a lightweight, terminal-based PC application and toolchain for drum pattern authoring, validation, and playback.  
Originally developed to support Nano Ardule firmware by providing pattern data and verification tools, APS has evolved into a standalone application that can be used independently of the hardware.

Core features include:

- **ADT text-based pattern editor**
- **ADT ↔ ADP conversion tools**
- **ARR chain editor and ADS stream compiler**
- **Pattern preview, visualization, and timing validation**
- **curses-based step sequencer with real-time playback**
- **Pattern indexing and structural analysis**
- **Optional MIDI output and debugging utilities**  
  (APS can operate fully without MIDI hardware)

## 4. Pattern Formats

| Format | Purpose | Details |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **ADT** | Editable 2-bar text pattern | Human-readable velocity symbols |
| **ADP** | Binary runtime pattern | Compact, fast parsing |
| **ADS** | Performance stream | Compiled chain + metadata |
| **ARR** | Chain description | Sections, repeats, transitions |

---

## 5. ADC Toolchain (adc- prefix) — MIDI → ADT Converters  
Located in: `tools/`

The ADC Toolchain converts external MIDI drum patterns into **ADT v2.2/v2.2a** format.

### Tools

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`adc-midtool.py`](./tools/adc-midtool.py) | Unified MIDI manager for batch processing all .MID files in a directory (scan, 8.3 rename, Type-1→0, INDEX.TXT, GM drum check, CSV/JSON). |
| [`adc-mid2report.py`](./tools/adc-mid2report.py) | Integrated MIDI report tool with triplet-aware subdivision analysis and ADT conversion hints. |
| [`adc-split-drum-2bar-save.py`](./tools/adc-split-drum-2bar-save.py) | CH10-only 2-bar MIDI slicer that saves <GEN>_Pnnn patterns, with optional grid PNG and A4 PDF export. |
| [`adc-drum-sim-matrix.py`](./tools/adc-drum-sim-matrix.py) | Compute all-pairs similarity matrices (Hamming/Cosine) for 2-bar CH10 drum pattern MIDI files using a 12-slot × N-column binary grid. |
| [`adc-mid2adt.py`](./tools/adc-mid2adt.py) | Convert 2-bar drum MIDI files to ADT v2.2a with auto grid detection and velocity symbols (. - X O). |
| [`adc-adt2adp.py`](./tools/adc-adt2adp.py) | Convert ADT v2.2a drum patterns to ADP v2.2 binary cache (fast load), with canonical velocity symbols (. - X O). |
| [`adc-mkindex.py`](./tools/adc-mkindex.py) | Scan ADP v2.2a pattern files and generate /SYSTEM/INDEX.TXT for Ardule/APS (genre, grid, length, CRC, size). |


### Example Workflow

```
python .\tools\adc-midtool.py
python .\tools\adc-mid2report.py .\INPUT.MID
python .\tools\adc-split-drum-2bar-save.py .\6AFROCUB.MID --genre LAT --export-grid --grid-pdf --start 31
python .\tools\adc-split-drum-2bar-save.py --print-genre-only .\6AFROCUB.MID
python .\tools\adc-mid2adt.py --in-dir MID --out-dir ADT
python .\tools\adc-adt2adp.py --in-dir ADT --out-dir ADP
```

# 🥁 Pattern Library

Includes (or supports) 2-bar patterns across genres:

- Rock, Funk, Jazz, Blues, Ballad, Pop  
- GM-compatible mapping  
- Velocity-aware notation  

---

## Common Execution Environment (APS & ADC)

The following execution environment is shared by **Ardule Pattern Studio (APS)** and the **ADC Toolchain**.  
This configuration is recommended for reliable operation across pattern editing, conversion, analysis, and playback.

### Python

- **Python 3.11.6**  
  Installed from **https://www.python.org**  
  > Microsoft Store Python distributions are not recommended due to known issues with terminal handling
  > (`curses`) and MIDI backends.

### Required Python Libraries

- `mido`
- `python-rtmidi`
- `windows-curses` (Windows only)

These libraries are required by both APS and ADC tools for MIDI handling, terminal-based UI,
and consistent runtime behavior.

### External Tools

- **Ghostscript**  
  Required by ADC tools that generate **PDF outputs** (e.g. drum grid visualization and A4 pattern sheets).

  Ghostscript must be available in the system `PATH`.

### Platform

- Windows 10 / Windows 11
- Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Windows Terminal

> APS and ADC tools can be used without MIDI hardware for editing, conversion, visualization, and analysis.  
> MIDI output is only required when using real-time playback or preview features.
