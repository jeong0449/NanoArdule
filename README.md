# Ardule Project — Arduino Nano-based Drum Patternology Ecosystem

> **Note:** This repository is currently undergoing internal testing.  
> Components will be released sequentially as they become stable.

**Ardule** is a complete open ecosystem for drum-pattern creation, conversion, playback, and analysis.  
It integrates **Arduino-based real-time drum engines**, a Python-based pattern studio (APS), a curated pattern library,  
and a family of **lightweight pattern formats (ADT, ADP, ADS, ARR)**.

With the addition of the **ADC Toolchain (adc- prefix)**, Ardule now supports automated conversion of MIDI drum patterns into ADT format, enabling seamless integration of external rhythm material into the ecosystem.

# 🌐 Ecosystem Overview

## 1. The Hardware: Nano Ardule

> Content will be added in a future update.

## 2. Nano Ardule Drum Pattern Player (Firmware)

> **Firmware scope**  
> This repository currently focuses on the **Drum Pattern Player firmware**, which implements the ADT/ADP-based
> pattern playback engine and serves as the reference implementation of the Ardule pattern system.  
>  
> Another firmware variant (e.g. a **Type-0 MIDI file player** with program change, layering, splitting, and more; see the demo video on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyeiwCxAJcU) exists internally and are not part of the public
> release at this time, but **may be published in the future as the project evolves and matures**.
A real-time drum pattern engine for **Arduino Nano / Nano Every**.

- ADS streaming engine  
- GM/GS/XG CH10 playback  
- Program Change kit switching  
- LCD user interface  
- MicroSD pattern library  
- MIDI routing

### 3. Ardule Pattern Studio — APS (PC Toolchain)

**Ardule Pattern Studio (APS)** is a lightweight, terminal-based PC application and toolchain for drum pattern authoring, validation, and playback.  
Originally developed to support Nano Ardule firmware by providing pattern data and verification tools, APS has evolved into a standalone application that can be used independently of the hardware.

Core features include:

- **ADT text-based pattern editor**
- **ADT ↔ ADP conversion tools**
- **ARR chain editor and ADS stream compiler**
- **Pattern preview, visualization, and timing validation**
- **curses-based step sequencer with real-time playback**
- **Pattern indexing and structural analysis**
- **Optional MIDI output and debugging utilities**  
  (APS can operate fully without MIDI hardware)

## 4. Pattern Formats

| Format | Purpose | Details |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **ADT** | Editable 2-bar text pattern | Human-readable velocity symbols |
| **ADP** | Binary runtime pattern | Compact, fast parsing |
| **ADS** | Performance stream | Compiled chain + metadata |
| **ARR** | Chain description | Sections, repeats, transitions |

---

## 5. ADC Toolchain (adc- prefix) — MIDI → ADT Converters  
Located in: `tools/`

The ADC Toolchain converts external MIDI drum patterns into **ADT v2.2/v2.2a** format.

### Tools

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`adc-midtool.py`](./tools/adc-midtool.py) | Unified MIDI manager (scan, rename to 8.3, Type1→0, INDEX.TXT, GM drum check, CSV/JSON) |
| [`adc-mid2report.py`](./tools/adc-mid2report.py) | Integrated MIDI report tool with triplet-aware subdivision analysis and ADT conversion hints. |
| [`adc-split-drum-2bar-save.py`](./tools/adc-split-drum-2bar-save.py) | CH10-only 2-bar MIDI slicer that saves <GEN>_Pnnn patterns, with optional grid PNG and A4 PDF export. |
| [`adc-drum-sim-matrix.py`](./tools/adc-drum-sim-matrix.py) | Compute all-pairs similarity matrices (Hamming/Cosine) for 2-bar CH10 drum pattern MIDI files using a 12-slot × N-column binary grid. |
| [`adc-mid2adt.py`](./tools/adc-mid2adt.py) | Convert 2-bar drum MIDI files to ADT v2.2a with auto grid detection and velocity symbols (. - X O). |
| [`adc-adt2adp.py`](./tools/adc-adt2adp.py) | Convert ADT v2.2a drum patterns to ADP v2.2 binary cache (fast load), with canonical velocity symbols (. - X O). |
| [`adc-mkindex.py`](./tools/adc-mkindex.py) | Scan ADP v2.2a pattern files and generate /SYSTEM/INDEX.TXT for Ardule/APS (genre, grid, length, CRC, size). |


### Example Workflow

```
python ./tools/adc-mid2adt.py input.mid -o pattern.adt
python ./tools/adc-clean.py pattern.adt
python ./tools/adc-adt2adp.py pattern.adt
```
